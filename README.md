# CannyEdgeOperator
Project for computer vision. Use canny edge operator to find the edge in pics. Due 11.15(Thursday)

1. Read file to get gray level value of picture.
2. Use gaussian filter to smooth the noise.
3. By using Prewitt operater to compute the gradient magnitude and gradient angle of horizontal and vertical directions.
4. Apply non-maxima suppression to normalize the ouput
5. Use p-tile thresholding to set threshold T.
6. Output the threshold T and total number of edges detected in edge image.

Plan:

2018-11-05
finish the input and the Gaussian part of program.

2018-11-07
finish prewitt and non-maxima part

2018-11-08
finish P-tile thresholding and output part.(Have trouble on same name error)

2018-11-09
Finished all codes and refactor some code formats.
